# 👋 Hello, I'm Yossef Haim!

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a **PHP Developer** and an **Educator**, passionate about creating meaningful and accessible solutions for people who need them the most.

In **2017**, I founded **ICALL**, a company dedicated to developing telephony services. Our flagship product, **Virtual Mail**, along with other innovative solutions, is used daily by thousands worldwide. These tools empower individuals without access to screens or smartphones—especially **visually impaired users**—to stay connected and informed.

### 🎯 Mission
My goal is to leverage technology to **bridge accessibility gaps**, empowering those who face technological barriers, particularly visually impaired individuals, to live more connected and informed lives.
