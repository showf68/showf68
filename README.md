# 👋 Welcome to Yossef Haim's GitHub!

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m **Yossef Haim**, a passionate **PHP Developer**, **Educator**, and creator of impactful technological solutions.

In **2017**, I founded **ICALL**, where I developed cutting-edge telephony services. Our flagship product, **[Virtual Mail](https://email36.com)**, empowers thousands of users daily, particularly visually impaired individuals and those without access to smartphones or screens. My focus is on **bridging accessibility gaps** through technology.

Beyond coding, I dedicate most of my time to **teaching Talmud** to my students at a local Yeshiva, where I aim to inspire and guide the next generation.
